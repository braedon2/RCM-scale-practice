* PWA manifest
* Level dropdown
  * Maybe have a dropdown instead of buttons when screen is too narrow (not sure about this one)
* Rework fingering randomization for prep level
  * currently overemphasizes free stroke over rest stroke
* Tooltip in top right ("i" circled or "?" circled) with a description of the tool and how the randomization works
* ~~Progress bar~~
* ~~local storage for level~~
